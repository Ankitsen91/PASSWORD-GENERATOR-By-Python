Sure, here's an example of what your README file could look like for the password generator script:

---

# Random Password Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates a random password of a specified length and optionally copies it to the clipboard using the `pyperclip` library.

## Features

- Generate random passwords containing letters, digits, and special characters.
- Specify the desired length of the generated password.
- Copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy use.

## Prerequisites

- Python (>= 3.6)
- `pyperclip` library (Install using `pip install pyperclip`)

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

### Running the Script

1. Run the following command to start the script:

   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

2. The script will prompt you to enter the desired length of the password.

3. If the entered length is valid (a positive integer), a random password of that length will be generated and displayed.

4. You'll be asked whether you want to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

5. If you choose 'y', the password will be copied to your clipboard, making it easy to paste into any application.
